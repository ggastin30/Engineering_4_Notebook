## Launch_Pad_Part_1

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to print out a countdown on the serial monitor from 10 - 0. When it reaches 0, it is supposed to print "LIFTOFF."

### Evidence

### Wiring

There is no wiring because we used the onboard LED.

### Code

### Reflection

This year, I figured out the hard way that F5 is not the standard for running code. Make sure to use CTRL S or D to run the code instead. Also, make sure to put the code into the code.py file from the board because it will not run if you just try to send it from the normal file. A handy tip is if you want to print some words but then a variable, separate them with a comma inside of the print statement.



## Launch_Pad_Part_2

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to flash an LED once every second of the ten-second countdown. Once it reached zero, we flashed a different LED to signal the launch.

### Reflection
This assignment was pretty basic because we could base most of it on the last assignment so we just had to add an LED flashing when the second changed. I did have a hard time creating a GIF for the evidence. I used ezgif and had to compress it after creating a GIF because it was too big. I also made a big mistake of writing on top of my old code when I did the assignment which cost me lots of valuable time to re-write the old code.



## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
